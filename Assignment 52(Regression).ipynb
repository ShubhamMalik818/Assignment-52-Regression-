    "Q1.  What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the model. \n",
    "     This penalty discourages the model from fitting the data too closely, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, do not add a penalty to the coefficients of the model. This means that \n",
    "these techniques are more likely to overfit the data.\n",
